Subscriptions
------------
In order to process **Subscriptions** the [WooCommerce Subscription Extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)
needs to be installed, which will add **Subscription Support** to the **WooCommerce Plugin**.

**Add Subscription Product**

* Login to the WordPress Admin Panel
* Go to ```Products``` -> ```Products```
* Click ```Add Product``` or choose a product to edit
* Choose ```Simple subscription``` from the **Product Data** dropdown menu
* Check ```Virtual``` or ```Downloadable``` if needed
* In tab ```General``` you can define your subscription details
    * **Subscription price** - will be used for the **Recurring Sale** Transactions
    * **Subscription length**
    * **Sign-up fee** - will be used once for the **InitRecurring** Transaction
    * **Free trial** - define the period, which the consumer will not pay the subscription price in.
* In tab ```Inventory``` check ```Sold individually``` if you don't want the subscription's quantity to be increased in the shopping cart.

**Manage Subscriptions:**
* Navigate to ```WooCommerce``` -> ```Subscriptions``` and choose your **Subscription**
* You can ```Suspend``` or ```Cancel``` a **Subscription** by using the links next to the Subscription's status label or change manually the Status
* When you enter into a **Subscription**, you can preview also the **Related Orders** and modify the **Billing Schedule**
* If you wish to perform a manual re-billing, choose ```Process renewal``` from the ```Subscriptions Actions``` dropdown list on the Right and click the button next to the dropdown.

**Refund a Subscription:**

You are only allowed to refund the `Sign-Up Fee` for a Subscription

* Navigate to ```WooCommerce``` -> ```Subscriptions``` and choose your Subscription
* Scroll down to the ```Related Orders``` and click on the ```Parent Order```
* Scroll down to the Order Items and click the **Refund** button.
* Define your amount for refund. Have in mind that the refundable amount may be lower than the total order amount, because the **Parent Order** might be related to **Init Recurring** & **Recurring Sale** Transactions.
  You are only allowed to **refund** the amount of the **Init Recurring** Transaction.

After a **Refund** is processed, the related **Subscription** should be marked as ```Canceled``` and a **Note** should be added to the **Subscription**

**Processing Recurring Transactions**

* Recurring payments are scheduled and executed by the **WooCommerce Subscription Plugin** and information email should be sent.

**Configuring WordPress Cron**

* If your **WordPress Site** is on a **Hosting**, login to your **C-Panel** and add a **Cron Job** for executing the WP Cron
```bash
cd /path/to/wordpress/root; php -q wp-cron.php
```

* If your Site is hosted at your **Server**, connect to the machine using **SSH** and type the following command in the **terminal** to edit your **Cron Jobs**
  Do not forget to replace `www-data` with your **WebServer User**
```bash
sudo crontab -u www-data -e
```

and add the following line to execute the **WordPress Cron** once per 10 Minutes

```sh
*/10 * * * * cd /path/to/wordpress/root && php -q wp-cron.php
```

__Note:__ If you are using Sale or Sale 3D for recurring transactions, please ensure that you contact tech support to obtain a **recurring token** used for renewal payments. The recurring token is mandatory for all consecutive transactions after the initial payment.


Refunds
------------
There are two ways of doing Refunds.

* Using integrated WooCommerce Refund functionality

    In that way, you can create a partial or full refund with restocking the desired items. This will create a WooCommerce Refund event.
    Partial or Full refund e-mail will be sent to the customer.
    You should choose the "Refund via emerchantpay Checkout/Direct" button if you want to send that refund to the Genesis Gateway.

* Using the emerchantpay Transaction List Table
    
    In that way, you will send a Refund to the Genesis Gateway without affecting the Order, unless the refund is not a full one. 
    If the full amount is refunded then the Order will become with status Refunded.   

Blocks
------------
To replace the existing checkout and switch to the new Checkout Block:

* Ensure that you have installed **WooCommerce** version **6.9** or newer, or download and install the [WooCommerce Blocks](https://woo.com/products/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/) plugin.
* Ensure that the current theme supports **Blocks**.
* Go to the **Pages** and then locate and edit the **Checkout page**.
* Remove the existing `[woocommerce_checkout]` Shortcode block.
* Search and add the **Checkout Block** to the page.
* If you have deleted the old Checkout page and added a new one, you can set it in ```WooCommerce``` -> ```Settings``` -> ```Advanced``` -> ```Checkout page```
* Alternatively you can use ```WooCommerce``` -> ```Status``` -> ```Tools``` -> ```Create Default WooCommerce Pages```
